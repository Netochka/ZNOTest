# ZNOTest

## Description:
This system is designed to check the answers of various forms formed according to a certain template. Forms are formed by the user, who indicates both the count of test tasks, and the correct answer to each of them.
The main users of the application are teachers of educational institutions who need to constantly check the work of students on the same sample. Also, potential users are students who are interested in automatically checking their work.
The goal is to create a project that simplifies the monotonous routine work of testing tasks by teachers, as well as a more convenient self-examination of their own work for students.
